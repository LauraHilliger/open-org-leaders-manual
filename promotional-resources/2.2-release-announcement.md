## About the book
From the publisher:

> Let's face it: The nature of work is changing. So the way we lead must change with it. In *The Open Organization* (Harvard Business Review Press), Red Hat president and CEO Jim Whitehurst explained how principles from open source software communities actually provide the tools for coping with—and thriving in—a context of rapid and unending change. In The Open Organization Leaders Manual, a community of open-minded writers, consultants, speakers, and educators explains how those same open principles can help leaders refine their approaches to setting goals, building organizational cultures, and motivating teams. Newly revised and significantly expanded in its second edition, this book is for anyone interested in building more transparent, agile, collaborative, and mission-driven organizations.
