## Visualizing your plans and progress
Jimmy Sjölund

In many organizations, strategic planning is the responsibility of only a few individuals. A management team might meet in a secluded offsite location, develop a corporate strategy or a set of team goals, then reveal them to the rest of the company. Sometimes they distribute a presentation afterward. They might issue updates throughout the year, but those updates come from the same small team that put the strategy together in the first place (and only if results meet objectives). The rest of the staff might get an update from time to time, especially if they're below the budget target and need to improve before the next quarter (budget targets they have no idea how to translate to their daily work). More likely, the plan winds up on the company intranet, where it languishes, never to been seen again until next year—when it's replaced with the new strategy or goals for the upcoming year. In some cases, they might reference it when they're presenting their new plan.

Is this just a dystopian picture I'm painting? Or have you actually worked in one of these companies?

Strategic planning of any type is more effective when it's *open*—that is, when leaders open their planning processes to feedback, and when progress toward the plan is transparent and clearly evident. To make this work, open leaders can *visualize* the plans to make them accessible to all organizational stakeholders.

But why make plans open in the first place? What are the benefits?

In short, Linus' Law applies to strategies as well as code: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

Everyone benefits from an open approach to planning. If everyone knows the direction we're headed and why, we can all continuously evaluate *together* whether what we're doing is contributing toward this goal or whether we should stop what we're currently doing because we realize it's not helping us on our path. The other great benefit is that the strategy remains open to further improvement through feedback from everyone in the company.

Over the years, I've picked up some methods for doing this simply and easily. And in this chapter, I'll share them with you.

### Spotify Rhythm

When it comes to visualizing work and working in agile ways, many turn to Spotify. When you begin examining Spotify, you soon end up watching a video of (or one made by) Henrik Kniberg.[^kniberg] One of these videos cover what's called the Spotify Rhythm.[^spotify-rhythm]

The Spotify Rhythm visualizes strategy as a series of concentric circles. In the center there are the "company beliefs," produced by the CEO, which typically span across the next three to five years. The next circle in their picture represents "north star" and "two-year goals."

The CEO and top management put these goals together. From those, then, Spotify makes "company bets," which are more hands-on projects or cross-organization initiatives. While using this method, "bet boards" spread to other departments, who set up their own boards or even tribe/team boards.

The company board gets updated and synced regularly by a strategy team, which sets the focus for the coming quarter. The "lower level" boards, then, update at a faster pace (usually every six weeks), and the level below *those* update perhaps every second week (or in two week sprints).

Spotify also uses tempo markers to indicate whether everything is running smoothly, work is moving a bit slower than expected, or something has halted or crashed completely. What the company learned from this was to not work on too many things at the same time, as that usually made things go slower or grind to a halt.

This method's openness helps teams see the direction the entire company is heading and align their own goals and work to follow that path. It helps teams make their own decisions about what to work on and where to go; they're still responsible for determining how to make best use of their time. That, in turn, will also add to their autonomy and motivation. It builds the community: We all know where we're going, why, and how we're doing along the way.

The Spotify Rhythm also makes visualization simple. It requires only a spreadsheet (as the company was updating continuously, it made most sense to use a simpler tool). Sometimes it's as easy as that. Whatever tool you choose, you'll need to make it accessible, of course, and communicate where to find it. But ultimately whether you do this through something like a spreadsheet, an intranet site, or a special tool doesn't matter. What matters is that it is *out in the open and people can find it*.

### A3 reports

A3 reports are the result of a work method or problem solving approach that emerged from Toyota and the Toyota Production System, which one could say ignited the worldwide "lean" movement. Toyota uses A3 reports for many purposes—from status reports, to proposal and policy changes, to (most notably) problem solving. The name for this method derives from the paper size it once required: the largest possible size you could still fit into a fax machine (today, as less is more, Toyota also promotes A4 reports!).

The A3 report should contain all necessary information for handling a specific problem or making a particular decision. The format differ depending on whether it's an A3 for problem solving, a proposal, a status report, or for strategic planning, but in general it includes: - A short description of the issue or background

- A status report of the current situation
- A description of future state or goals/targets
- An analysis of or a statement on the root cause (in case of problem solving)
- Suggestions for alternative improvements or solutions - A recommended action, next steps or a time plan
- An analysis of the cost and value (if applicable)
- Follow up

The A3 process is based on the Deming Cycle: *Plan, Do, Study, Act*. One of the advantages with an A3 report is that it makes plans visible and easier to read quickly, but one must remember it's also only one step in the decision-making process. Another piece is the *nemawashi* process, where the principle is to do decision-making slowly and in consensus.

Many people will circulate and discuss an A3 report before it's presented to decision makers or management. Feedback it receives along the way helps to perfect the report so that when it's time to make a decision the information is clear and to the point. This potentially makes decisions take longer—but when everyone is on board, implementations are much faster.

It's imperative to stress again: *the A3 is not the tool*. The A3 is the result of the iterative process of analyzing the situation; it's the visualization method. In Toyota Kata, it's used in the dialogue between the mentor and the adept. The important thing is *how* and *why* an A3 is developed and used, not the format or the report itself.

A strategy-focused A3 is by nature future-oriented. It gathers the future goals and needs, and will cascade down through the organization to people's daily work. The visualization is important and easily communicated by this one-page condensed message. In the *nemawashi* process, many have already had the opportunity to give feedback and through the visualization of the A3 everyone can quickly be reminded of the strategy and how their work is aligned with the goals and achievements.

### Servant Manager Door

In his book *Toolbox for the Agile Coach: Visualization Examples*, Jimmy Janlén describes a method known as "Servant Manager Door."[^visualization-examples] The basic gist of this method is that a manager or leadership will have a small (kanbanesque) board displayed, usually on their door or in a common space. The board is to show what focus that manager has on impediments that need their support outside of the teams or department.

It's an easy way to show what you're currently focusing on—and being transparent about what you are currently not focusing on. A simple board with three columns is more than enough; the board only needs to include what's next, what's currently be worked on, and what has been done. And leaders can easily set this up in a simple, digital way if teams are spread across different locations.

What this method provides is constant feedback to teams that the leaders are involved. The transparency makes sure everyone knows the status of different improvements, which in turn helps to build trust within the organization.

### Open, always

Planning and working in the open always has advantages: - People and groups that come together with a shared purpose are extremely powerful. With clear priorities communicated everywhere and shared with everyone, you'll get a much better understanding of how your work contributes to the organizational big picture. This improves your autonomy as you can steer your own actions toward the common goal.

- Transparency helps facilitate feedback loops. Being able to make decisions closer to the source is beneficial, of course, but transparency can also improve collaboration and feelings of community. You never know what inspiring or useful feedback you might receive from unexpected sources.

- Visualizing work can make the imaginary wall between management and workers disappear, and they can encourage everyone to feel more engaged in their everyday work.

Whether you select a team kanban board, a Servant Manager Door, or the company bets, if your methods are transparent and open for comment, you'll grow as a community and as an organization. You might even make some more money by focusing on the right thing to do.
